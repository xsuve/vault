`2020 Series`
# Vault - Organize your Website Connection Details
Vault was the first SaaS platform that featured payment gateway integration via PayPal. It was all about storing your website connection details, such as cPanel, FTP, phpMyAdmin data on the platform and later share it with your development team. So basically you would store it once and use it with as many members as much as you want.

### Development
* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* JavaScript/jQuery
* PayPal payments

### Custom PHP Framework
It used a super basic custom PHP framework that can be found here: https://github.com/panique/mini

### Years Active
Was born in early 2020, but soon closed, because there it couldn't find any support for the targeted audience, since it was not the best execution regarding the idea.
