;Connection Information
[Http]
; Add Curl Constants to be configured
; The settings provided in configurations would override defaults
; if provided in configurations
http.CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT = 30

; Adding HTTP Headers to each request sent to PayPal APIs
;http.headers.PayPal-Partner-Attribution-Id = 123123123

;http.Proxy=http://[username:password]@hostname[:port]

;Service Configuration
[Service]
; can be set to sandbox / live
mode = live

;Logging Information
[Log]
log.LogEnabled=true

; When using a relative path, the log file is created
; relative to the .php file that is the entry point
; for this request. You can also provide an absolute
; path here
log.FileName=../PayPal.log

; Logging level can be one of
; Sandbox Environments: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
; Live Environments: INFO, WARN, ERROR
; Logging is most verbose in the 'DEBUG' level and
; decreases as you proceed towards ERROR
; DEBUG level is disabled for live, to not log sensitive information.
; If the level is set to DEBUG, it will be reduced to FINE automatically,
; with a warning message
log.LogLevel=INFO

;Validation Configuration
[validation]
; If validation is set to strict, the PayPalModel would make sure that
; there are proper accessors (Getters and Setters) for each model
; objects. Accepted value is
; 'log'     : logs the error message to logger only (default)
; 'strict'  : throws a php notice message
; 'disable' : disable the validation
validation.level=disable

;Caching Configuration
[cache]
; If Cache is enabled, it stores the access token retrieved from ClientId and Secret from the
; server into a file provided by the cache.FileName option or by using
; the constant $CACHE_PATH value in PayPal/Cache/AuthorizationCache if the option is omitted/empty.
; If the value is set to 'true', it would try to create a file and store the information.
; For any other value, it would disable it
; Please note, this is a very good performance improvement, and we would encourage you to
; set this up properly to reduce the number of calls, to almost 50% on normal use cases
; PLEASE NOTE: You may need to provide proper write permissions to /var directory under PayPal-PHP-SDK on
; your hosting server or whichever custom directory you choose
cache.enabled=true
; When using a relative path, the cache file is created
; relative to the .php file that is the entry point
; for this request. You can also provide an absolute
; path here
cache.FileName=../auth.cache
